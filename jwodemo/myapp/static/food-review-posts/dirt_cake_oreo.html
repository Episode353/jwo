                        <p>The colorful image, and <em>"Gummy Worm Inspired Sprinkles" on top imply a fun Oreo, which this does not disappoint</em>.</p>
                        <p>While the Oreo is not <em>boring</em> by any means, the rainbow glitter sparkles do not have much of a taste, and are purely decorative.</p>
                        <p>Leaving those out of the picture, the two layers are very amazing, but admittedly, very dry without the cow juice.</p>
                        <p>I also could not see eating more than a handful of these in one sitting.</p>
                        <p>Definitely worth a try, but don't feel like you're missing out.</p>
